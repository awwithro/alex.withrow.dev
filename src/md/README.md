# Welcome

This is the CLI version of the site. Why? CLIs are great!

## Markdown

Markdown files are being rendered with [glow](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow). Which is made by the charmbraclet team. It's a golang tool. I'm using it here mostly since i've used it before and didn't want to find an alternate in java script. Their stuff is really great. I use their wish tool in my ink project.

## Filesystem

The fake file system is being provided by the aptly named [FakeFileSystem.js](https://github.com/SkwalExe/FakeFileSystem.js). Its rather simple to add and remove files using it and has built in support for relative paths so why not?
